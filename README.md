## Usage

quizdown is easy to setup and best used in combination with existing static site generators like *Jekyll*, *Hugo* or *Sphinx*. Check out the extensions
[hugo-quiz](https://github.com/bonartm/hugo-quiz) and [sphinxcontrib-quizdown](https://github.com/bonartm/sphinxcontrib-quizdown).

## Stand-alone Example

Add the library to your website and initialize with default options:

```html
<head>
	...
    <script 
	src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kheitkamp/quizdown-js@v0.5.0.2/public/build/quizdown.min.js">
	</script>
	<script>quizdown.init();</script>
	...
</head>
```

To keep the bundle size low, syntax highlighting and math rendering are implemented in separate extensions that can be loaded and registered manually if needed: 

```html
<head>
	...
    <script src="./build/quizdown.js"></script>
	<script src="./build/extensions/quizdownKatex.js"></script>
	<script src="./build/extensions/quizdownHighlight.js"></script>
	<script>
		quizdown.register(quizdownKatex).register(quizdownHighlight).init();
	</script>
	...
</head>
```
