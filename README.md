> Markdownish syntax to instantly create simple interactive quiz apps for your static website.

I'm working on this project in my free time to learn more about modern web development and languages. This is a toy project and should not be used in serious projects for now. 

### ðŸš€ Try the [quizdown live editor](https://bonartm.github.io/quizdown-live-editor/)

- supports markdown text formatting, images, syntax highlighting and math rendering.
- different [quiz-types](./docs/syntax.md): single-choice, multiple-choice, sequence.
- support for [hints and explanations](./docs/syntax.md#hints-and-comments).
- [options](./docs/options.md) for color theme, question shuffling, localization.
- can be easily included in any website, static site generator or [other web projects](./docs/module_import.md).
- mobile friendly with touch support for all question types.

## Usage

quizdown is easy to setup and best used in combination with existing static site generators like *Jekyll*, *Hugo* or *Sphinx*. Check out the extensions
[hugo-quiz](https://github.com/bonartm/hugo-quiz) and [sphinxcontrib-quizdown](https://github.com/bonartm/sphinxcontrib-quizdown).

### ðŸ“š [Documentation](./docs/)

## Stand-alone Example

Add the library to your website and initialize with default options:

```html
<head>
	...
    <script 
	src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/quizdown@latest/public/build/quizdown.js">
	</script>
	<script>quizdown.init();</script>
	...
</head>
```

To keep the bundle size low, syntax highlighting and math rendering are implemented in separate extensions that can be loaded and registered manually if needed: 

```html
<head>
	...
    <script src="./build/quizdown.js"></script>
	<script src="./build/extensions/quizdownKatex.js"></script>
	<script src="./build/extensions/quizdownHighlight.js"></script>
	<script>
		quizdown.register(quizdownKatex).register(quizdownHighlight).init();
	</script>
	...
</head>
```

Write questions within a `quizdown` class (edit in the [ðŸš€quizdown editor](https://bonartm.github.io/quizdown-live-editor/?code=---%0AprimaryColor%3A%20steelblue%0AshuffleQuestions%3A%20false%0AshuffleAnswers%3A%20true%0A---%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Select%20your%20superpowers!%0A%0A-%20%5B%20%5D%20Enhanced%20Strength%0A-%20%5B%20%5D%20Levitation%0A-%20%5Bx%5D%20Shapeshifting%0A%0A%23%23%23%20What%27s%20the%20capital%20of%20Germany%3F%0A%0A%3E%20Hint%3A%20The%20_largest_%20city%20in%20Germany...%0A%0A1.%20%5Bx%5D%20Berlin%0A1.%20%5B%20%5D%20Frankfurt%0A1.%20%5B%20%5D%20Paris%0A1.%20%5B%20%5D%20Cologne)):
